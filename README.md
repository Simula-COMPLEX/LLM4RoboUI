# LLM Prompt for Uncertainty Identification in Self-Adaptive Robotic

This repository contains a file named `LLMsPrompt`, featuring a role-based prompt designed to identify uncertainties in self-adaptive robotics using large language models (LLMs). 
The prompt provides detailed step-by-step instructions for LLMs and an uncertainty questionnaire that covers essential uncertainty factors throughout the robotics software engineering lifecycle.
