## üìÇ Repository Contents

### 1. Prompt (`LLMsPrompt.pdf`) File
- A **role-based prompt** designed to identify uncertainties in self-adaptive robotics using large language models (LLMs). 
- Includes:
  - Step-by-step instructions for LLMs.
  - An **uncertainty questionnaire** covering key uncertainty factors across the robotics software engineering lifecycle.

### 2. Findings and Analysis (`Appendix-Additional-Results.pdf`) File
- Results from additional analyses, including:
  - **Cohen‚Äôs Kappa (K)**: Used to assess inter-rater reliability of the results.
  - **Non-parametric Confidence Intervals**: Calculated using the **Bootstrap method** for more statistical insights.
